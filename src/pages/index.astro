      I build dependable systems — primarily in software, occasionally in the
      physical world. My work centers on data pipelines, cloud infrastructure,
      and the operational patterns that make systems secure, maintainable, and
      resilient over time.
    </p>

    <p>
      I’m particularly interested in mission-aligned domains like climate and
      energy, health, and public-interest technology. I care about privacy,
      durability, and long-term alignment — both in the systems we build and
      the communities they serve.
    </p>

    <h2>What I’m focused on</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Designing and operating data & ML infrastructure that is observable,
        cost-conscious, and privacy-aware.
      </li>
      <li>
        Exploring climate and energy systems — informed by prior work forecasting
        building energy usage.
      </li>
      <li>
        Documenting architecture decisions, tradeoffs, and experiments in
        public.
      </li>
      <li>
        Continuing to refine a professional path aligned with long-term
        impact and community.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>This site</h2>

    <p>
      This is a working notebook — a place to clarify ideas, share technical
      explorations, and think out loud about infrastructure and systems.
      It’s intentionally minimal and evolving.
