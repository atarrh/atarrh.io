    <h1>About</h1>

    <p>
      I’m Andrew Tarrh — a software engineer with a backend / data-engineering bent.
      I’ve spent my career building and operating data pipelines and cloud-native
      systems, with a particular focus on reliability, privacy, and cost-conscious
      design.
    </p>

    <p>
      Earlier in my career I worked on Amazon Alexa’s Machine Learning Data Platform,
      where I helped maintain large-scale ETL workflows and the operational tooling
      behind them. That environment shaped how I work: I care about clear ownership,
      pragmatic instrumentation, and making systems easier (and safer) to operate.
    </p>

    <p>
      In recent years I stepped back from full-time roles while I focused on building
      my personal home and expanding my hands-on skill set. That time has also helped
      me get clearer about what I want next: work that feels aligned with real-world
      impact — especially in areas like climate/energy and health.
    </p>

    <h2>What I’m doing now</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Volunteering with <strong>WeVote</strong>, contributing UI components and bug
        fixes in a Node/React/Flux web app and making improvements to a Python/Django
        API endpoints server.
      </li>
      <li>
        Rebuilding my professional presence (including this site) to better showcase
        the systems work I’ve done and the kinds of problems I want to solve next.
      </li>
      <li>
        Continuing to explore mission-driven domains — informed by projects like my
        master’s capstone forecasting energy usage for university buildings.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What I’m looking for</h2>
    <p>
      I’m aiming for a role (or contract work) where I can help a small-to-mid-sized
      team build dependable data and ML infrastructure: pipelines, orchestration,
      observability, and the patterns that keep systems secure and maintainable.
      I’m especially interested in organizations that take privacy seriously and
      are working on climate/energy, healthcare, or other public-benefit outcomes.
    </p>

    <p>
      I’m currently based in <strong>Tucson, Arizona</strong>, and I’m open to remote
      work (including part-time) as well as relocating for the right mission-aligned
      opportunity.
    </p>

    <h2>A note on values</h2>
    <p>
      I care a lot about community, sustainability, and housing justice. I’m
      interested in models like community land trusts and co-housing, and I try to
      make career choices that balance practical needs with long-term alignment.
